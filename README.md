Workout 1

This is the first workout assignment of Stat 133. We will be creating different ways to rank NBA teams. We will pretend that we don't know the numbers of wins and losses of each team and rank them in more creative ways, more similar to ways that universites and countries are ranked. 

This assignment will focus on how to using ggplot2 and dplyr and how to create and work wth more complex file structures.
